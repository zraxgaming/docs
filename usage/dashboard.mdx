    <p>Quick deployment checklist and common install steps for zdev projects.</p>

    **Pre-deploy**

    - Create `.env.local` from `.env.example` and add your license and environment variables.
    - Verify Node version (check `.nvmrc` if provided) and install dependencies.

    **Build & Deploy (example)**

    ```bash
    # from project root
    cp .env.example .env.local
    npm install
    npm run build
    # deploy (Vercel example)
    vercel --prod
    ```

    **Notes & tips**

    - Use the environment variables and paths provided in your delivery package.
    - For self-hosting: build the static output and serve with Nginx or a simple static host. For containerized deploys, build into a Docker image and set runtime env vars from secrets.
    - After deploy, verify the license activation and portal URLs in a private/incognito window.
