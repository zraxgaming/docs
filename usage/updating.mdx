# Updating Content and Styles

This guide shows where to change text, images, and styles in your project.

---

## Text and pages

- Edit page files in `/pages` or `/app` (depending on framework). Pages import components from `/components` and reference text directly.
- For repeated copy, check for `locales`, JSON/YAML content files, or a CMS integration.

## Images and static assets

- Put images in `/public` and reference them by path (e.g., `/images/logo.png`).
- Optimize large images before upload to reduce build time and bandwidth.

## Styles and Tailwind

- If the project uses Tailwind, update `tailwind.config.js` for theme tokens and `styles/globals.css` for base rules.
- For plain CSS, edit the relevant CSS or SCSS files in `/styles`.

## Typical folders referenced

- **Components:** `/components`
- **Pages:** `/pages` or `/app`
- **Public assets:** `/public`

---

## Deploying updates

- For Vercel: push to the configured branch or use the Vercel dashboard to redeploy.
- For manual uploads: build (`npm run build`) then upload the generated `dist` or `.vercel/output` depending on the framework.

Example deploy commands:

```bash
# build
npm run build

# Vercel deploy (example)
vercel --prod
```
