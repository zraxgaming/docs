# Troubleshooting

Common quick fixes for zdev projects.

---

## App won't start
- Cause: missing env variables or incorrect `.env.local`.
- Fix: copy `.env.example` → `.env.local`, reinstall deps, and restart.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## License activation fails
- Cause: wrong license key or missing env var.
- Fix: confirm license value in `.env.local` and contact support if problems persist.
