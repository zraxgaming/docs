# Installation & Deployment

This page explains general installation steps and deployment options for zdev projects. Use the specific provider pages (Vercel, self-hosting, Docker) for detailed instructions.

---

## Pre-install checklist

- Copy `.env.example` → `.env.local` and add the license key and any environment variables provided in your delivery.
- Verify Node version and runtime requirements (check `.nvmrc` or `engines` in `package.json`).
- Ensure build tools (e.g., `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`) are installed.

---

## Build steps (typical)

```bash
# install deps
npm install

# build
npm run build
```

After building, follow your host's deployment instructions (Vercel, Netlify, static host, or container registry).

---

## Provider-specific guides

- Vercel: see `deployment/vercel` for an example workflow and domain setup.
- Self-hosting: build static assets and serve with Nginx or a static server.
- Docker: build a production image and run with environment variables from secrets.

Use the variables and paths provided in your delivery package.
