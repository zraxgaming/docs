# Deploying to Vercel

Vercel provides a simple workflow for most zdev projects. This guide covers a common flow using the Vercel web dashboard and the CLI.

---

## Quick steps (web)

1. Connect your repository to Vercel (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).
2. Configure environment variables in the Vercel project settings (copy from `.env.local`).
3. Select the correct framework preset (Next.js, static, etc.) and choose the build command (usually `npm run build`) and output directory.
4. Deploy — Vercel will build and publish automatically on push.

---

## Using the Vercel CLI

```bash
# login
vercel login

# from project root, deploy
vercel --prod
```

## Notes

- Make sure license-related env vars are set in the Vercel dashboard so activation works in production.
- After deploy, visit your site in an incognito window to verify assets and license activation.
